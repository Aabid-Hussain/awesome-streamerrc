## Setup

> NOTE: A more thorough guide will eventually be written on how to set all of this up.

I am currently using `neovim` and `plug` for my setup. To get started, make sure you have `neovim` installed and the configuration file in the `~/.config/nvim/init.vim` location.

Feel free to make any changes/suggestions via a `merge request`.

Thank you! <3
